# Monitoring and Detection of Incidents in Big Data Applications 

This project illustrates monitoring, detection and classification of incidents in Big Data applications on a simple example. 

## Introduction

We introduce a generic architecture of an incident management system that can be adapted to the specific needs of Cloud-based Big Data analytics applications. 

## Software needed

The simulation fo teh Big Data application uses the following Software to simulate the incident used to illustrate the functionality. 

* Elasticserach
* Logstash 
* Kibana
* Docker
* https://github.com/rdsea/IoTCloudSamples
* Hadoop
* Apache Nifi
